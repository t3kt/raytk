For example, bends sideways (towards X) depending on the vertical position (along Y).

* `Enable` - Enables or disables the op.
* `Direction` - Chooses the axis to bend along and the axis to bend towards.
* `Amount` - Amount of bending.
* `Shift` - Shifts the center of the bending along the main axis.
