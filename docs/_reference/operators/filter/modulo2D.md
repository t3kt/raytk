  - label: Size
    name: Size

    summary: The spacing of the grid along the two axes. This sets the size of the
      cell taken from the input.

Repeats space along 2 axes.

This has the effect of making an infinite grid of copies of (slices/cells of) the input, but without the cost of having
to separately calculate each copy.
