    summary: The function that is applied to the results of the source field. In cases
      where the source field produces vectors but the function only works of single
      values, the function will be called 4 times. That can end up costly if the function
      is complex, though most function ops are relatively cheap.

Reshapes the values produced by a field by applying a function.

If the source field produces float values, the function is just applied to those values, returning whatever type the function returns.
If the source field produces vector values, the function is applied individually to each channel in the produced values.
If the source is an SDF, the function is applied to the distance value in the SDF result.
