Repeats its input some number of times, exposing the index as the iteration x value, and combines the results.

It is important to note that unless something in the input chain is making use of the iteration to change or
move those copies, they will all be in the same position. The `rangeTransform` operator is designed for this
purpose, though there are also other ops that can do so.

Refer to the Iteration guide for details.

It is also important to note that this operator, like `radialClone` evaluates its input separately for each
iteration, which can cause a significant drain on resources if the input network is complex or costly.
