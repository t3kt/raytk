    In a sense, this has some similar properties to `modulo2D` in that it

    takes a slice of space and repeats it. But instead of repeating it linearly

    along the x and y axes, it does so with polar coordinates (angle and distance).


    Important note: if the input pattern / shape does not tile correctly for the

    slice that''s used, you will get a discontinuity (break in space). This is similar

    to how you shapes can get cut off when using `modulo1D` / etc.


    When using 2D coordinates, the `Axis` is ignored, and the first axis is always
    X and the second is always Y.'

Transforms space using a logarithmic spiral.

See this article for a good description of the concept:
https://isohedral.ca/escher-like-spiral-tilings/

In a sense, this has some similar properties to `modulo2D` in that it
takes a slice of space and repeats it. But instead of repeating it linearly
along the x and y axes, it does so with polar coordinates (angle and distance).

Important note: if the input pattern / shape does not tile correctly for the
slice that's used, you will get a discontinuity (break in space). This is similar
to how you shapes can get cut off when using `modulo1D` / etc.

When using 2D coordinates, the `Axis` is ignored, and the first axis is always X and the second is always Y.
