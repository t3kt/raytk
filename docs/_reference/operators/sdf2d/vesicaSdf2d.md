  - label: Radius

    readOnlyHandling: baked
    regularHandling: runtime
    summary: The radius of each circle.
  - label: Distance
    name: Distance
    readOnlyHandling: baked
    regularHandling: runtime
    summary: The distance between the circles. Higher values will produce thinner
      shapes since the circles will overlap less. Lower values will produce rounder
      shapes, eventually reaching a full circle when the distance is 0.
  summary: SDF for a 2d vesica, which is a shape based on the overlap between two
    circles.
