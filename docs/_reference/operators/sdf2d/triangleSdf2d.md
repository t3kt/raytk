  parameters:
  - label: Shape
    menuOptions:
    - description: An equilateral triangle (all sides are the same). This is defined
        based on `Radius`. The triangle is centered around the origin.
      label: Equilateral Triangle
      name: equilateral
    - description: An iscosceles triangle (2 sides are the same). This is defined
        based on `Width` and `Height`. The tip of the triangle is placed at the origin.
      label: Isosceles Triangle
      name: isosceles
    - label: Inverted Isosceles Triangle
      name: invertisosceles
    - description: An arbitrary triangle based on 3 points.
      label: Abritrary Triangle
      name: arbitrary
    name: Shape
    readOnlyHandling: semibaked
    regularHandling: semibaked
    summary: Which type of triangle to produce. The types are defined by different
      sets of parameters.
  - label: Radius
    name: Radius
    readOnlyHandling: semibaked
    regularHandling: runtime
    summary: The distance from the center to each corner of the triangle. Used for
      equilateral triangles.
  - label: Height
    name: Height
    readOnlyHandling: semibaked
    regularHandling: runtime
    summary: The distance from the base of an iscosceles triangle to the opposite
      tip.
  - label: Width
    name: Width
    readOnlyHandling: semibaked
    regularHandling: runtime
    summary: The width of the base of an isosceles triangle.
  - label: Point 1
    name: Point1
    readOnlyHandling: baked
    regularHandling: runtime
    summary: The first corner position, for an arbitrary triangle.
  - label: Point 2
    name: Point2
    readOnlyHandling: baked
    regularHandling: runtime
    summary: The second corner position, for an arbitrary triangle.
  - label: Point 3
    name: Point3
    readOnlyHandling: baked
    regularHandling: runtime
    summary: The third corner position, for an arbitrary triangle.
