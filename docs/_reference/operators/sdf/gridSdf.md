    summary: allows the shape to be used in a 2D context.

    summary: choose which axis the grid should face.
  - label: Spacing
    name: Spacing
    readOnlyHandling: baked
    regularHandling: runtime
    summary: spacing between the bars of the grid. If this value is very small and
      the `Thickness` is high enough, the bars can merge into a solid surface. But
      if it is set to zero the grid will disappear due to a calculation error.
  - label: Axis Offset
    name: Axisoffset
    readOnlyHandling: baked
    regularHandling: runtime
    summary: shifts the grid forwards or backwards along the `Axis` that it is facing.
      Not available in 2D mode.
  - label: Offset
    name: Offset
    readOnlyHandling: baked
    regularHandling: runtime
    summary: shifts the grid along its plane.
  - label: Thickness
    name: Thickness
    readOnlyHandling: baked
    regularHandling: runtime
    summary: the thickness of the bars.
