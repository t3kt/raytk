    summary: Offsets the surface of the shape. Positive values expand the shape and
      negative values contract it. This is equivalent to the `round` operator.
  - label: Thickness
    name: Thickness
    readOnlyHandling: baked
    regularHandling: runtime
    summary: For surface-based fields, this is the thickness of the area where the
      value is 1.
  - label: Blending
    name: Blending
    readOnlyHandling: baked
    regularHandling: runtime
    summary: The distance over which the 1 area transitions to the 0 area.
  summary: Value field based on an SDF shape.
