# cellTileField

Category: field
OP Type: raytk.operators.field.cellTileField



A value field that provides an approximation of repeating cellular (voronoi) noise.

Based on Biomine by Shane (https://www.shadertoy.com/view/4lyGzR).
Uses a minimum blend at various 3D locations on a cubic tile. Make the tile wrappable by ensuring the objects wrap around the edges.
It isn't perfect but it is low cost.
