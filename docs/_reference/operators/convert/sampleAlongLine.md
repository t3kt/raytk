  parameters:
  - label: Center
    name: Center
    readOnlyHandling: baked
    regularHandling: runtime
    summary: Position in 2D/3D space where the center of the line sits. When a position
      of 0 is passed to this operator, it will check its input at the Center location.
  - label: Direction
    name: Direction
    readOnlyHandling: baked
    regularHandling: runtime
    summary: Vector indicating which direction the line goes from the center.
  - label: Rotate
    name: Rotate
    readOnlyHandling: baked
    regularHandling: runtime
    summary: Rotation for the sampling line.
  status: beta
  summary: Samples a 2D/3D input along a single line, producing a 1D function.

Samples a 2D/3D input along a single line, producing a 1D function.

It's similar to crossSection but with a single line instead of a 2D plane.
