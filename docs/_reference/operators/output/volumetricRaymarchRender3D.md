  detail: 'Note that this renderer is actively being developed, so it may have some
    bugs or limitations.


    This renderer uses steps that have a constant size, rather than stepping different
    distances based on how far an SDF says they are from the surface. This makes it
    more suitable for volumes that are based on fields of density rather than SDFs.


    There are two main modes: Solid and Cloud.


    Solid mode behaves similarly to regular raymarching, where the rays stop once
    they hit an area with a density of 1 or more. Then it uses shading similar to
    a regular `raymarchRender3D`. This mode works best with volumes that are based
    on SDFs.


    Cloud mode sends rays through the volume, and at each step, it checks the density
    of the volume. Rays don''t stop marching until they go through the bounding area.
    The density and color accumulate as the rays go through the volume to produce
    the final results.'
