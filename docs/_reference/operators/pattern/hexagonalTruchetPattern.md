Pattern using truchet tiling in a hexagonal arrangement.

This operator produces different types of values from the grid depending on the selected Pattern.

Truchet patterns involve a curving path through a grid (in this case hexagonal), where the path is always uninterrupted, but may sometimes form closed loops.
