Combines SDFs in various ways.

Depending on which `Combine` option is selected, different parameters will be enabled.
This operator only supports two input SDFs (along with a value field to control blending).
To combine more than two SDFs, use one of the specialized operators like [`simpleUnion`](/raytk/reference/operators/combine/).
