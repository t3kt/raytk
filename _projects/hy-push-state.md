**hy-push-state** is a web component that lets you turn web pages into web apps. The component dynamically loads new content (formerly known as "ajax") and inserts it into the current page, without causing Flash of White, Flash of Unstyled Content, etc.

> Turn static web sites into dynamic web apps.

**hy-push-state** is similar to [pjax] and [smoothState], but offers a [more advanced pre-fetching logic][pref] and gives you more control over its internals to enable [advanced page transition animations][anim].

**hy-push-state** is already used by hundreds of sites as part of the [Hydejack] Jekyll theme.
